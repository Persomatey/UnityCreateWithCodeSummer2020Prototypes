# Unity Create With Code Summer 2020 Prototypes

Using this repository to store the prototypes made during Unity's Create With Code: Summer 2020 course

Prototype 1 |
----------- |
This is a simple third person driving prototype where two players are able to move their cars around an obstacle course. |
I did the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Hard</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype. |
<i>Additionally, I also added a feature at the end of the obstacle course where the cars do a jump at the end and the player loses control of the car. </i> |

Optional Challenge 1 |
-------------------- |
A Simple sideview flying game where the player controls the plane using the up and down arrow keys to navigate throught the obstacle course. |
<i>I fixed all 8 parts of this optional challenge. </i> |

Prototype 2 |
----------- |
This is a simple topdown game where the player must feed the animals running forward with cookies. Each animal has a "hunger meter" that they must fill up and the player has a number of "hit points" before they lose. |
I did the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype. |
<i>Additionally, I also added a "Game Over" screen when the player loses all of their hitpoints. </i> |

Optional Challenge 2 |
-------------------- |
A sideview ball-catching game where the player strategically spawns dogs that run to catch balls that continuously fall from specific locations in the sky. | 
<i> I fixed all 8 parts of this optional challenge </i> |

Prototype 3 |
----------- |
This is a simple sidescrolling infinite autorunner where the player can only control jumping over obstacles they are running towards. |
I did the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype. |
<i> Aditionally, I added a feature where it shows the player score. The score increases by 10 each time the player jumps over an obstacle (20 if holding B to for the "super speed" ability") </i>|

Optional Challenge 3 |
-------------------- |
A sidescrolling balloon jumper where the player holds down the spacebar to make a balloon float higher to dodge bombs or collect money. |
<i> I fixed all 8 parts of this optional challenge </i> |

Prototype 4 |
----------- |
A top down sumo-like game where the player controls a ball and has to knock increasingly difficult endless waves of enemies of enemy balls off the platform. | 
I am having trouble finding the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype... | 

Optional Challenge 4 |
-------------------- |
<i> not attempted yet </i>

Personal Project (Veggierena)| 
----------- |
A top-down Zelda-like arena fighter where the player controls a tomatoe and fights off increasingly difficult endless waves of vegitables by chopping them up. |
