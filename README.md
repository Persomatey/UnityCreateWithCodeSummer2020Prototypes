Using this repository to store the prototypes made during Unity's Create With Code: Summer 2020 course

Prototype 1 |
----------- |
This is a simple third person driving prototype where two players are able to move their cars around an obstacle course. |
I did the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Hard</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype. |
<i>Additionally, I also added a feature at the end of the obstacle course where the cars do a jump at the end and the player loses control of the car. </i> |

Optional Challenge 1 |
-------------------- |
I did the optional challenge to fix the bugs in the auto flying game as well. A Simpple sideview flying game where the player controls the plane and is able to fly throught the obstacle course. |
<i>I fixed all 8 parts of this optional challenge. </i> |

Prototype 2 |
----------- |
This is a simple topdown game where the player must feed the animals running forward with cookies. Each animal has a "hunger meter" that they must fill up and the player has a number of "hit points" before they lose. |
I did the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>Expert</b> bonus features for the prototype. |
<i>Additionally, I also added a "Game Over" screen when the player loses all of their hitpoints. </i> |

-------------------- |
<i>I have yet to do the optional challenge for this prototype. </i> |

Prototype 3 |

I did the <b>Easy</b> and <b>Medium</b> bonus challenges. for th e prototype. I have yet to do the <b>Hard</b> and <b>Expert</b> bonus challenges. |
<i> Aditionally, I added a a feature where it shows the player score. The score increases by 10 each time the player jumps over an obstacle. </i>|
