# Unity Create With Code Summer 2020 Prototypes

Using this repository to store the prototypes made during Unity's Create With Code: Summer 2020 course

### Prototype 1: 
This is a simple third person driving prototype where two players are able to move their cars around an obstacle course. 

I did the optional challenge to fix the bugs in the auto flying game as well. A Simpple sideview flying game where the player controls the plane and is able to fly throught he obstacle course. 

### Prototype 2: 
This is a simple topdown game where the player must feed the animals running forward with cookies. Each animal has a "hunger meter" that they must fill up and the player has a number of "hit points" before they lose. 

### Prototype 3: 
In progress... 

### Prototype 4:
